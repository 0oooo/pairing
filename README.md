# Pairing Experiment

## Mission 
To create some toy games in react using remote pair programming.

## Pair programming 

inspired by https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html

 - Pomodoros of 25 mins with 5 mins break or reflexion time.
 - At the beginning of each pomodoro we will set a small task together (idealy an atomic commit)
 - Then split into driver and navigator not unlike how the article descirbes the process.
 - Use Live share with the navigator enabling follow participant funciton.
 - Hi-Five will be used for celebration of team acheivments.
 - At the end of each session we should talk about how its working and how to improve our pairing.
